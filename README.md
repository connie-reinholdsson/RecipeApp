### Overview

This project is related to a talk I gave at Droidcon London 2017 called 'Three key lessons when migrating to ConstraintLayout' and a [Medium article](https://medium.com/p/dff38c31a47/edit) I wrote.

In this project I am investigating the transitioning process of migrating a number of legacy layouts to `ConstraintLayout`. I am using Android's Studio's auto converter tool to migrate the layouts specified below.

### Layouts:
* `RelativeLayout`
* `RelativeLayout` with one nested `RelativeLayout`
* `RelativeLayout` with one nested `LinearLayout`
* `LinearLayout` with one nested `LinearLayout`
* `RelativeLayouts` with three nested `RelativeLayouts` 

### Results:
The converted layouts show the final result after repositioning the views. Click [here](https://medium.com/p/dff38c31a47/edit) to find out more!
